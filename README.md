## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,HTML,CSS,ES6,Bootstrap,Node</sub> </br>
This is my first official full stack project. I tried to do a little too much with it, but I have definitely learned a great deal. It is a tech blog in which a user is able to link articles and post blogs. They can also view blogs and links, upvote them, and comment on them. The user is able to create an account and then log in to access the features of the site. The user session is tracked with express sessions. The site is built with an MVC structure, using sequelize and handlebars.js.
